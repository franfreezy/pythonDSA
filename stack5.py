#29. Write a py program that sorts the stack (using a Deque) elements.
#Test Data:
#Create a stack object:
#Input and store (using Deque) some elements onto the stack:
#Stack elements are: 1 3 2 6 5 -1 0
#Sort the stack items in ascending order:
#Stack elements are: -1 0 1 2 3 5 6
#Remove two elements from the stack:
#Stack elements are: -1 0 1 2 3
#Input three elements onto the stack:
#Stack elements are: -1 0 1 2 3 4 7 -2
#Sort the said items in ascending order:
#Stack elements are: -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 7
