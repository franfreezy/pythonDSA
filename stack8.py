#26. Write a py program that reverses the stack (using a vector) elements.
#Test Data:
#Create a stack object:
#Input and store (using vector) some elements onto the stack:
#Stack elements are: 1 3 2 6 5 -1 0
#Reverse the elements of the said stack:
#Stack elements are: 0 -1 5 6 2 3 1
#Remove two elements from the stack:
#Stack elements are: 0 -1 5 6 2
#Input three elements onto the stack:
#Stack elements are: 0 -1 5 6 2 4 7 -2
#Reverse the elements of the said stack:
#Stack elements are: -2 7 4 2 6 5 -1 0
