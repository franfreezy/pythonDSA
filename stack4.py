#30. Write a py program that reverse the stack (using a Deque) elements.
#Test Data:
#Create a stack object:
#Input and store (using Deque) some elements onto the stack:
#Stack elements are: 1 3 2 6 5 -1 0
#Reverse the stack items in ascending order:
#Stack elements are: 0 -1 5 6 2 3 1
#Remove two elements from the stack:
#Stack elements are: 0 -1 5 6 2
#Input three elements onto the stack:
#Stack elements are: 0 -1 5 6 2 4 7 -2
#Reverse the said items in ascending order:
#Stack elements are: -2 7 4 2 6 5 -1 0
