#Input two more elements
#Stack elements: 10 -1 5 2 4 7
#Average of the said stack values: 4.50
#
#
#6. Write a py program to find the maximum element in a stack (using an array).

#Input two more elements
#Stack elements: 10 -1 5 2 4 7
#Maximum value: 10
#
#
#7. Write a py program to find the minimum element in a stack (using an array).
#Test Data:
#Input some elements onto the stack:
#Stack elements: 0 1 5 2 4 7
#Minimum value: 0
#Remove two elements:
#Stack elements: 5 2 4 7
#Input two more elements
#Stack elements: 10 -1 5 2 4 7
#Minimum value: -1
#
#
#8. Write a py program to find the middle element of a stack (using an array).
#Test Data:
#Input some elements onto the stack:
#Stack elements are: 5 2 4 7
#Middle element of the stack: 2
#Input three more elements
#Stack elements are: -3 -2 -1 5 2 4 7
#Middle element of the stack: 5
#
#
#9. Write a py program to delete the middle element of a stack (using an array).
#Test Data:
#Input some elements onto the stack:
#Stack elements are: 5 2 4 7
#Delete the middle element of the stack:
#Stack elements are: 5 4 7
#Input two more elements
#Stack elements are: -2 -1 5 4 7
#Delete the middle element of the stack:
#Stack elements are: -2 -1 4 7
#
#
#10. Write a py program to find and remove the largest element in a stack.
#Test Data:
#Input some elements onto the stack:
#Stack elements are: 5 2 4 7
#Find and remove the largest element 7 from the stack.
#Stack elements are: 5 2 4
#Input two more elements
#Stack elements are: 20 -1 5 2 4
#Find and remove the largest element 20 from the stack.
#Stack elements are: -1 5 2 4
#
#
#11. Write a py program to find and remove the lowest element in a stack.
#Test Data:
#Input some elements onto the stack:
#Stack elements are: 5 2 4 7
#Find and remove the lowest element 2 from the stack.
#Stack elements are: 5 4 7
#Input two more elements
#Stack elements are: 2 -1 5 4 7
#Find and remove the lowest element -1 from the stack.
#Stack elements are: 2 5 4 7
#
#
