#28. Write a py program to implement a stack using a Deque with push and pop operations. Check if the stack is empty or not and find the top element of the stack.
#Test Data:
#Initialize a stack using deque:
#Is the stack empty? Yes
#Input some elements onto the stack:
#Deque elements are: 1 5 3 4 2
#Top element is 2
#Remove two elements from the stack:
#Deque elements are: 1 5 3
#Top element is 3
#Input two more elements onto the stack:
#Deque elements are: 1 5 3 8 9
#Top element is 9
