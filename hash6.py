#Insertion of keys into hash table using linear probing as collision resolution technique –
#Que – 2. The keys 12, 18, 13, 2, 3, 23, 5 and 15 are inserted into an initially 
# empty hash table of length 10 using open addressing with hash function h(k) = k mod 10 
# and linear probing. What is the resultant hash table?
